# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical user experience and functionality issues in NeuroNest, focusing on authentication flow fixes, UI layout improvements, drag-and-drop optimization, and enhanced task stress marking capabilities. These improvements will create a more professional, seamless, and ADHD-friendly user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a clean interface without visible layout debugging boxes
2. WHEN a user visits the signup page THEN the system SHALL display a clean interface without visible layout debugging boxes
3. WHEN the pages load THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and alignment without visual artifacts
4. IF there are layout containers THEN they SHALL be invisible to the end user while maintaining proper structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user managing my schedule, I want seamless drag-and-drop functionality in the weekly view without time mismatches or slot errors, so that I can efficiently organize my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a task is dropped in the weekly view THEN the system SHALL update the database with the precise time slot
3. WHEN time slots are displayed THEN they SHALL show accurate time labels without mismatches
4. IF a drag operation fails THEN the system SHALL revert the task to its original position
5. WHEN multiple tasks are moved THEN the system SHALL maintain time accuracy for all operations
6. IF time conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with ADHD, I want to hover over tasks in the weekly view and click an icon to mark them as stressful, so that I can quickly categorize tasks based on my stress levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a task in the weekly view THEN the system SHALL display a stress indicator icon
2. WHEN a user clicks the stress indicator icon THEN the system SHALL toggle the task's stressful status
3. WHEN a task is marked as stressful THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN the stress status changes THEN the system SHALL persist the change to the database
5. IF the hover interaction is interrupted THEN the system SHALL hide the stress indicator appropriately
6. WHEN a task is already marked as stressful THEN the icon SHALL indicate the current status clearly
7. IF the database update fails THEN the system SHALL revert the visual change and show an error message
